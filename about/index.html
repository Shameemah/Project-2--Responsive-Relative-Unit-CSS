          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
          I was born and raised in Ghana, a beautiful country in West Africa, with one older
          sister, my mother and father. After completing my high school education at SOS 
          Hermann Gmeiner International College in 2014, I moved to the USA for college. I 
          initially started out as an Architecture and switched to Information Technology 
          and Management after a year. In my opinion, this was one of the best decisions I've 
          ever made. I am currently pursuing both my bachelors and masters in ITM with a 
          specialization in Software Development and Data management respectively. I
          work as a freelance Graphic Designer in my free time.

          <p>
          After college, I hope to own my very own Graphics Design firm. I also hope to start
          a company that focuses on teaching young women in Ghana how to code. In terms of ITM,
          I am willing to go wherever the wind takes me.
