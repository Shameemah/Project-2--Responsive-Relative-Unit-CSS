          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
          I was born and raised in Ghana, a beautiful country in West Africa, with one older
          sister, my mother and father. After completing my high school education at SOS 
          Hermann Gmeiner International College in 2014, I moved to the USA for college. I 
          initially started out as an Architecture major and switched to Information Technology 
          and Management after a year. In my opinion, this was one of the best decisions I've 
          ever made. I am currently pursuing both my bachelors and masters in Information Technology 
          and Management with a 
          specialization in Software Development and Data management respectively. I
          work as a freelance Graphic Designer and UI designer in my free time You can see examples of the work I have done on my <a class="socialmedia" href="/portfolio">portfolio page</a>.

          <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
          <p>
          It has always been my dream to start a school that aims at giving young women in Africa free education in the Technology sector. This is my longterm goal and is what I am working hard towards. However, after graduating from college, I hope work with a top technology firm that bridges the gap between art and technology. I believe that most people see these 2 sectors as completely different things. However, companies like Adobe prove that it is possible to merge the two. Although I have very specific goals and aspirations, I am willing to go wherever he wind takes me.
