          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
          Welcome to my first website! This website contains my digital portfolio, resume and a little information about who I am. In the future, I hope to include a blog and a photography page. For anyone interested in the technical tools used to build the website, the Github repository lives <a id="github" href="https://github.com/Shameemah/Project-2--Responsive-Relative-Unit-CSS">here.</a> 
          </p>
          <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
         I believe that every individual has the potential to be the best versions of themselves, when surrounded by the right people, and given the right support. I believe in bringing light to the people around you; encourage, support, love, laugh. I believe that every person must learn tolerance and respect in order to live peacefully amongst others, and that we as people, should see every opportunity as a chance to learn and grow. I believe in the empowerment of women and in the disruption of patriarchy. As I go on my journey through life, it is my hope that eventually, I will be able to give back to the communities that made me who I am, and to those who did not have the opportunities I did. I am taking life one step at a time; living, laughing and loving! It is my hope that we will all see the light in life, and that no matter we go through, we will remain unbroken, positive and grateful.
          </p>
