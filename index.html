          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
          Welcome to my first website! This website contains my digital portfolio, resume and a little information about who I am. In the future, I hope to include a blog and a photography page. For anyone interested in the technical tools used to build the website, the Github repository lives <a id="github" href="https://github.com/Shameemah/Project-2--Responsive-Relative-Unit-CSS">here.</a> 
          </p>
          <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
         I believe that every individual has the potential to be the best versions of themselves, when surrounded by the right people, and given the right support. I believe in bringing light to the people around you; encourage, support, love, laugh. I believe that every person must learn tolerance and respect in order to live peacefully amongst others, and that we as people, should see every opportunity as a chance to learn and grow. I believe in the empowerment of women and in the disruption of patriarchy. As I go on my journey through life, it is my hope that eventually, I will be able to give back to the communities that made me who I am, and to those who did not have the opportunities I did. I am taking life one step at a time; living, laughing and loving! It is my hope that we will all see the light in life, and that no matter what we go through, we will remain unbroken, positive and grateful.
          </p>
