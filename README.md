Project Description:
This project builds on Project One, which I will fully style with CSS to provide a basic typographic treatment and responsive design that makes judicious use of media queries and relative units (em/rem, vw, %). I will deploy my pages to a server pointed at by my personal domain name.

Project Goals:
1. Produce modern standards-compliant, mobile-first CSS
2. Organize site typography with a modular scale, and set type on a baseline grid
3. Execute responsive design with flexible media and fluid grids, expressed as percentages
4. Continue to write and revise valid, well-formed semantic HTML
5. Effectively comment on and format source code for maximum readability
6. Track the development of a project over time and collaborate with others using version control
7. Deploy web pages to a public server (can be GitHub pages, set up with your own domain name or subdomain)
